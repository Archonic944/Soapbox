## Overall flow

1. User creates an invite link
2. Friends join (3-6 people)
3. Settings are set (⭐️):
    - Rotation time period
    - Max word count
    - Quizzes (Y/N)
    - Archive articles (Y/N, time period)
    - Anonymous (Y/N)
4. At start of rotation, everyone shares their topic (all topics are revealed at once)
5. Random rotation of friends selected through a spinner (?) animation
    - (someone needs to plan the animation + the arrangement of this screen in general)
6. Landing page displays a countdown to the next article + other article dates below it
    - UI design for landing page
    - Banner with unread articles
