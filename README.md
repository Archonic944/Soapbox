With Soapbox, you can finally make your friends listen to you. In exchange, they have to listen to you, too.

## How it works

Friends join a blog rotation together. Each friend gets a turn to write a blog post about *whatever* they want, up to a specified word limit. 
When their blog comes out, **everybody has to read it**. 

Not only that, but you are required to **take a quiz** (generated by Gemini) about your friend's blog. They can even see your scores, so they know who's a real friend.
